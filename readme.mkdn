# Readme

This is a chrome extension to automatically close the zoom post attenedee tab. 

## Why?
In work from home life, I'm in 5 - 10 meetings a day, both internal and external. I often click on the link in my calendar and at the end of the day, realize a bunch of zoom tabs are left open in my browser. For some reason, this really irritated me. 

## Installation
Once the extension actually get's approved, you can install it there, and a link will be provided here. 
For now, you can download this repo, and install in chrome using the "load unpacked" button [here](chrome://extensions/).
